# ENSIP-XX: Verifiable Credentials & Presentations

### Abstract

This ENSIP aims to standardize the usage of [W3C Verifiable Credentials & Presentations](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) within ENS records.

### Motivation

With the increasing prevalence of self-custodial digital identity & attestation solutions, it is of importance to have a standardized way to publicly share verifiable credentials using your ENS profile.

### Specification

#### Very Rough Draft

did/url links to vc
vc contains **metadata** **claims** & **proof**
implementations choose what "proof"s they support (aka, what credentials they accept/trust)
claims are the actual data thats being attested

#### Verifications in Profiles

Defines the use of the `verifications` record.
This record aims to store a list of verifiable credentials or did's, pointing towards certain credentials

Examples of these records would be:

```
https://myapp.com/credentials/1234.json
https://api.myapp.com/verifications/1234?token=abc123
// ipfs
// did
```

#### Credentials & Presentations

The documents stored in the `verifications` record are verifiable credentials or presentations following the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).
These credentials are JSON-LD documents that contain a set of claims, metadata, and proof, signed by the issuer.

#### End-User Experience

The end-user experience of this ENSIP is to allow users to publicly share their verifiable credentials in a standardized way.
Users visit an app that lets them create a verifiable credential, and then share the link to that credential in their ENS profile.

Name Manager Applications can then read these credentials and display them in a user-friendly way.
As well as allow for setting/revoking credentials.

#### Example

An example of a verifiable credential

```json
// this example is wip
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://example.com/credentials/3847",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", ""],
  "issuanceDate": "2024-05-21T00:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:ens:luc.eth",
  }
}
```

or in the form of a presentation:

```json
// this example is wip
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
  ],
  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
  "verfiableCredential": [
    {
      "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
        "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
      ],
      "id": "https://credentials.dentity.com/credentials/1234",
      "type": [
        "VerifiableCredential",
        "ProofOfTwitterCredential"
      ],
      "issuer": {
        "id": "did:ens:idp.eth"
      },
      "issuanceDate": "2000-00-00T00:00:00Z",
      "twitter": "lucemansnl",
      "proof": {
          "verificationMethod": "did:ens:idp.eth",
          "signature": "..."
      }
   }
  ],
  "id": "12345",
  "holder": "did:ens:luc.eth",
  "proof": {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Considerations

#### Revocation & Expiration

Verifiable Credentials are meant to be used as long-lived documents.
However this does not mean that they can't be revoked or expired.
In a similar manner to physical documents, a credentials validity can be checked by contacting the issuer (Think of how a store might only look at your drivers license, while a car dealership would run it through a computer).

The implementation of verification is specific to each issuer, and can be inferred from `verificationMethod` in the credential.
In addition to the `expirationDate` field, which causes the credential to invalidate after a certain date.

This means that identity platforms can allow users to revoke (or expand) credentials without needing to modify the records in ENS.

### Backwards Compatibility

This ENSIP relies on the existing ENS text record functionality introduced in [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5), and only standardizes the usage of the specific `verifications` record.

### Security Considerations

None.
